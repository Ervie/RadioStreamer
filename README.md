# RadioStreamer
Website with embedded player allowing user to listen internet radio channels.

Currently as uni project, might be rewritten from scratch in the future.

Ideas/improvements:

- Change Hybrid UI (MVC C# controllers with ajax requests) to Single Page Application (with javascript front-end framework)
- Implement Css as SASS/LESS
- Add statistics view for user
- Allow adding own channels
